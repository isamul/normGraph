# Benchmark

The benchmark has been conducted with three configuraions:
- NormGraph
- 4o
- 4o+RAG

This folder contains the benchmarking notebooks for automatically testing the *4o* as well as the *4o+RAG* reference models. *NormGraph* itself has been benchmarked using LangGraph Studio manually, while using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) for token-count data.
